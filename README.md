- **Front End** is the part of website that user/client directly interacts with;
  + It may be images, tables, buttons, menu;
  + It should be **responsive** that is appear correctly on devices of all sizes(no abnormal behaviour);
  + Front end languages: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, while HTML and CSS deal with styling and designing(the look), JS deals with the functionalities(for eg. click on button or arrow keys pressed in a JS game);
