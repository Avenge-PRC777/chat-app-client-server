# Client-Server Architecture

## What is front-end and backend?

- **Front End** is the part of website that user/client directly interacts with;
  + It may be images, tables, buttons, menu;
  + It should be **responsive** that is appear correctly on devices of all sizes(no abnormal behaviour);
  + Front end languages: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**;
  + HTML and CSS deal with styling and designing(the look);
  + JS deals with the functionalities(for eg. click on button or arrow keys pressed in a JS game);
  + Front end extensions: AngularJS, React.js, jQuery, SASS, Bootstrap;
  + Angular JS is a framework used to make Single page web apps, React.js is a JS library to create UI

- **Back End** is the part that handles server side;
  + Tasks like storing data in a database, calling APIs;
  + Client has no control over it, only server side programmers;
  + Back end languages: **PHP,JavaScript(Yes),Node.js, Python, REST, Ruby**;
  + Node.js is **runtime environment** to execute JS code outside a browser(for eg. to run HelloWorld.js,i.e to see output, use node);
  + Back end frameworks: **Express**, Django, Spring;

## Okay, so what about nature of webapps?

- There are three kinds of web products
  + Websites: show static pages to all;
  + Webapp: pages shown are different for clients(customized to client data);
  + **Traditional webapps**:client has to ask from server information/data;
  + **Real time webapps**:information is transmitted almost instantaneously between users and servers(between users too)
